# Claude Agent Setup Complete ✓

## What Was Created

### 4 Specialized Agents

1. **Code Review Agent** ([agents/code-reviewer.md](agents/code-reviewer.md))
   - Reviews code for security, architecture, and quality
   - SlideRx-specific checks (Docker, N8N, AWS integration)
   - Commands: `/review`, `/review-pr`

2. **Workflow Debugger Agent** ([agents/workflow-debugger.md](agents/workflow-debugger.md))
   - Diagnoses N8N workflow failures
   - Troubleshoots integrations (S3, OpenRouter, PDF service)
   - Command: `/debug-workflow`

3. **Workflow Builder Agent** ([agents/workflow-builder.md](agents/workflow-builder.md))
   - Creates and modifies N8N workflows
   - Follows SlideRx patterns and best practices
   - Command: `/build-workflow`

4. **Deployment Helper Agent** ([agents/deployment-helper.md](agents/deployment-helper.md))
   - Manages deployments and configuration
   - Handles backups, health checks, rollbacks
   - Command: `/deploy`

### 5 Slash Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `/review` | Review code changes or specific files |
| `/review-pr` | Review entire pull request or branch |
| `/debug-workflow` | Debug N8N workflow execution issues |
| `/build-workflow` | Create or modify workflows |
| `/deploy` | Deploy, configure, or maintain infrastructure |

### Documentation

- [README.md](README.md) - Complete guide to all agents and commands
- [CODE_REVIEW_GUIDE.md](CODE_REVIEW_GUIDE.md) - Detailed code review documentation
- [SETUP_COMPLETE.md](SETUP_COMPLETE.md) - This file

## Quick Start

### Try It Now

```bash
# Review the PDF service (tested and working!)
/review pdf_services.py

# Debug a workflow
/debug-workflow stage1

# Build a new feature
/build-workflow add retry logic to S3 uploads

# Check system health
/deploy health check all services
```

### Example Workflows

**Before Committing:**
```bash
/review
```

**Before Creating PR:**
```bash
/review-pr feature/my-branch
```

**When Something Breaks:**
```bash
/debug-workflow webhook not triggering
```

**Adding New Features:**
```bash
/build-workflow add email notifications on completion
```

**Deploying Updates:**
```bash
/deploy update production with latest changes
```

## What Each Agent Knows

All agents understand the SlideRx architecture:
- Two-stage workflow (stage1 → stage2)
- Docker Compose setup (N8N + PDF services)
- ngrok webhook exposure
- AWS integration (S3, Lambda, API Gateway)
- OpenRouter AI integration
- PDF processing patterns

## Testing Results

✅ **Code Review Agent Tested**
Reviewed [pdf_services.py](../pdf_services.py):
- No critical issues found
- Identified minor improvements (logging, file size limits)
- Provided actionable recommendations
- Correctly referenced SlideRx architecture

## Next Steps

1. **Try the commands** - Start using `/review`, `/debug-workflow`, etc.
2. **Customize agents** - Edit agent files to match your preferences
3. **Add more agents** - Create project-specific agents as needed
4. **Share feedback** - Improve agents based on real usage

## Benefits

### For Development
- **Faster code reviews** - Automated first pass before human review
- **Consistent standards** - Same review criteria every time
- **Knowledge capture** - SlideRx patterns encoded in agents
- **Onboarding** - New developers get instant context

### For Debugging
- **Faster diagnosis** - Systematic troubleshooting
- **Common issues** - Known problems and solutions
- **Integration checks** - Verify all services working
- **Log analysis** - Automated log inspection

### For Operations
- **Safer deployments** - Checklists and validation
- **Quick rollbacks** - Documented procedures
- **Health monitoring** - Consistent health checks
- **Configuration management** - Track all settings

## Tips for Success

1. **Be Specific**: Include file names and error messages
2. **Chain Agents**: Use multiple agents for complex tasks
3. **Review Often**: Run `/review` before every commit
4. **Debug First**: Diagnose before modifying
5. **Document**: Agents help, but understand the changes

## Customization

### Add New Agent

```bash
# 1. Create agent config
nano .claude/agents/my-agent.md

# 2. Create command
nano .claude/commands/my-command.md

# 3. Document in README
nano .claude/README.md
```

### Modify Existing Agent

```bash
# Edit agent behavior
nano .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md

# Update command description
nano .claude/commands/review.md
```

## Support

- **Ask Claude**: "How do I use the code review agent?"
- **Read Docs**: Check [README.md](README.md) for examples
- **Experiment**: Try different command variations
- **Improve**: Edit agents based on your needs

**All agents are ready to use! Start with `/review` to see them in action.**
