## Executive Summary

### Purpose
SlideRx is an AI-powered presentation condensation tool that transforms bloated 25-40 slide business decks into crisp 3-slide executive summaries while teaching users presentation best practices. Unlike simple AI assistants that polish existing content, SlideRx fundamentally restructures presentations and explains the "why" behind every decision.

### Background
Corporate professionals waste hours creating and consuming presentation decks that executives don't have time to read. The average business presentation has 38 slides, uses font size 7-9, and takes 40+ minutes to present. Executives typically allocate 3-5 minutes for most presentations. This mismatch kills careers, wastes time, and buries important ideas in presentation bloat.

Current AI tools (Gamma.ai, Microsoft Copilot, ChatGPT) polish or expand presentations but don't solve the core problem: **too much content, not enough impact**.

### Goals (Hackathon - 16 Days)
1. **Demonstrate working end-to-end flow**: Upload PDF → AI analysis → 3-slide summary → downloadable output
2. **Showcase unique value**: "Why We Cut This" explanatory feature that educates users
3. **Prove technical feasibility**: AI-powered presentation analysis and restructuring
4. **Create foundation**: Extensible architecture for post-hackathon development

### Success Metrics
- ✅ Complete user flow: Upload → Analyze → Download (3 clicks or less)
- ✅ AI successfully condenses 30+ slide deck to 3 slides in < 60 seconds
- ✅ "Why We Cut This" report provides specific, actionable feedback
- ✅ Demo works reliably for 5+ different presentation types
- ✅ User accounts persist session data across browser sessions

## Press Release (Amazon PR/FAQ Style)

### Headline
**SlideRx Launches: Your CEO Doesn't Have 40 Minutes. We Give Them 3.**

### Subheading
AI-powered presentation tool condenses bloated business decks into executive-ready summaries while teaching you how to create impactful presentations.

### Summary Paragraph
Today, SlideRx launches to solve the epidemic of death-by-PowerPoint plaguing corporate professionals worldwide. Using advanced AI and proven presentation principles, SlideRx analyzes your 25-40 slide deck and distills it into a focused 3-slide summary that executives actually want to see: The Problem, The Solution, and The Ask. Unlike presentation assistants that add more slides or polish existing ones, SlideRx is the first tool that actually condenses while explaining presentation principles through its "Why We Cut This" educational feature.

### Problem Paragraph
Corporate professionals face a career-limiting problem: they create presentations that executives don't have time to read. The average business deck has 38 slides with dense text, complex charts, and buried conclusions. Executives allocate 3-5 minutes for most presentations, but presenters deliver 40-minute marathons. The result? Rejected proposals, missed promotions, and brilliant ideas lost in slide bloat. Existing AI tools make this worse by helping users create even more content instead of ruthlessly cutting to what matters.

### Solution Paragraph
SlideRx uses AI trained on presentation best practices to restructure your deck into three essential slides: Problem (visual + one sentence), Solution (diagram/data viz + one sentence), and The Ask (clear CTA + one sentence). But SlideRx doesn't just cut—it teaches. The "Why We Cut This" report explains each decision with specific principles: "Slides 7-12 were background context—moved to appendix because executives start with decisions, not history." "Slide 15 had 6 bullet points—condensed to visual metaphor because executives process images 60,000x faster than text." Over time, users internalize these principles and create better presentations from scratch.

### Leadership Quote
"We built SlideRx after watching too many talented professionals get rejected because they buried their best ideas on slide 38," said [Your Name], Product Lead. "Executives aren't being difficult—they're being efficient. SlideRx helps you respect their time while advancing your career. It's not about dumbing down your ideas; it's about crystallizing them into their most powerful form."

### Customer Quote
"Before SlideRx: 40 slides, 12% approval rate. After SlideRx: 3 slides, 89% approval rate. But more importantly, I learned why my presentations were failing. The 'Why We Cut This' report was like having a presentation coach review every slide. Now I create better decks from the start."
— Sample Corporate Professional (Persona)

### How to Get Started
Visit SlideRx, upload your PDF presentation, answer one question ("What's the business purpose?"), and receive your 3-slide summary with educational feedback in under 60 seconds. Your condensed presentation and learning insights are saved to your account for future reference.

## Problem Definition & Context

### The Problem (Framework: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How)

**WHO:** Corporate professionals, product managers, consultants, and business analysts who present to executives

**WHAT:** They create presentations that are too long, too dense, and bury key messages, resulting in rejection, confusion, and wasted time

**WHEN:** During critical career moments—budget requests, project approvals, status updates, pitch presentations, problem justifications

**WHERE:** In the presentation creation process (structural decisions about content organization) and delivery phase (executive meetings with limited time)

**WHY:** This is worth solving because:
- **Career Impact**: Presentation skills directly correlate with promotion rates (64% of executives cite "inability to communicate concisely" as a top reason for denying promotions)
- **Time Waste**: Organizations waste $37B annually on ineffective meetings, largely due to poor presentations
- **Decision Quality**: Important ideas get rejected not on merit but because they're poorly communicated
- **Skill Gap**: Most professionals never receive presentation training beyond "make it pretty"

**HOW:** Currently handled through:
- Trial and error (career-damaging)
- Manual condensation (time-consuming, unclear what to cut)
- Presentation consultants ($200-500/hour, not scalable)
- Generic AI tools that expand rather than condense

### User Pain Points (Validated)

#### Primary Pain Points:
1. **"I don't know what to cut"**: Professionals believe all content is important; lack framework for ruthless prioritization
2. **"My deck gets rejected before I present"**: Executives see 40 slides and decline the meeting
3. **"I bury my conclusion on slide 38"**: Traditional structure (background → analysis → conclusion) fails with time-constrained executives
4. **"I can't visualize complex ideas simply"**: Over-reliance on text and bullet points instead of visual communication
5. **"I don't know why my presentations fail"**: No feedback loop for improvement

#### Secondary Pain Points:
6. Font size decreases as deadline approaches (7-9pt common)
7. Slide count inflation during review cycles
8. Inconsistent messaging across slides
9. Lack of clear call-to-action
10. Presentation anxiety from knowing deck is too long

### Market Context

#### Market Opportunity
- **Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: 50M+ corporate professionals who create presentations
- **Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)**: 15M professionals in mid-to-large companies with executive presentation requirements
- **Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)**: 500K early adopters frustrated with existing tools (Year 1 target)

#### Competitive Landscape

| Competitor | Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses | SlideRx Advantage |
|------------|----------|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Gamma.ai** | AI generation from prompts | Beautiful templates, fast creation | Confusing one-sentence-at-a-time flow, creates MORE slides | Purpose-driven condensation, not expansion |
| **Microsoft Copilot** | Polish existing slides | Native Office integration | Polishes but doesn't condense, no structural changes | Actually reduces slide count, restructures narratives |
| **ChatGPT/Claude** | General AI assistance | Flexible, powerful | Generic advice, no slide manipulation, no accountability | Specialized for presentations, actionable output with explanations |
| **Beautiful.ai** | Template-based design | Professional aesthetics | Doesn't address content bloat | Content-first approach, teaches principles |
| **Presentation Consultants** | Human expertise | Deep expertise, custom solutions | $200-500/hour, slow, not scalable | Instant feedback, $0-9/month, scales infinitely |

#### Competitive Advantages
1. **Only tool that condenses**: Competitors expand or polish; SlideRx cuts ruthlessly
2. **Educational approach**: "Why We Cut This" teaches users to fish, not just gives them fish
3. **Outcome-oriented**: Organized by business purpose (Pitch, Budget Request, etc.), not generic templates
4. **Evidence-based**: Built on proven presentation principles (Duarte, Roam), not arbitrary AI decisions

### Business Justification

#### Strategic Alignment

**Jobs-to-be-Done:**
When I need to **present a complex product strategy to executives**,
I want to **distill 40 slides of analysis into a compelling 3-slide narrative**,
So I can **get budget approval and demonstrate executive communication skills** (advancing my career).

**Success Scenario with SlideRx:**
1. Alex creates comprehensive 40-slide deck (analysis, data, strategy)
2. Uploads to SlideRx, selects "Budget Request" as purpose
3. Receives 3-slide summary in 60 seconds: Problem (market gap), Solution (product strategy), Ask ($2M budget with clear ROI)
4. Reviews "Why We Cut This" report: learns that slides 5-15 (market analysis) should be appendix, that 6-bullet lists should be single visuals, that conclusion must be on slide 3
5. Downloads PDF, presents to exec team
6. Gets 15-minute discussion (not 40-minute lecture)
7. Budget approved
8. Uses learnings to create better decks from scratch

**Quote:** "I'm not a bad communicator—I just wasn't trained to think like an executive. SlideRx taught me to start with the decision, not the background."

- **Token Management**: Limit input context (summarize each slide first if needed)
- **Output Validation**: Ensure 3 slides always returned (fallback if AI fails)

**System Prompt Framework** (Condensed):
```
You are a presentation strategist trained in Nancy Duarte and Dan Roam principles.
Analyze the uploaded presentation and condense to exactly 3 slides:

SLIDE 1 - THE PROBLEM:
- Identify the core problem/opportunity (not background)
- Describe ONE visual that conveys problem magnitude
- Write ONE sentence (max 15 words) that crystallizes the problem

SLIDE 2 - THE SOLUTION:
- Describe the proposed solution (not how it works, but what it achieves)
- Describe ONE visual (diagram, data viz, metaphor) showing before/after or impact
- Write ONE sentence (max 15 words) that states the solution

SLIDE 3 - THE ASK:
- State specific request (budget amount, approval, decision, next step)
- Describe ONE visual showing timeline, ROI, or success criteria
- Write ONE sentence (max 15 words) that states the ask clearly

RULES:
- No bullet points (executives process visuals 60,000x faster than text)
- No background/history (start with decision, not context)
- No jargon (executives are busy, not stupid)
- Specific visuals (not "chart showing data" but "bar chart comparing Q1 revenue $2M vs. Q4 target $5M")
```

**User Story**:
> As Ambitious Alex, I want SlideRx to condense my 40-slide deck to 3 essential slides, so that I can present to executives in 5 minutes instead of 40 minutes.

**Edge Cases**:
- Presentation has no clear problem/solution (AI requests clarification or makes best guess with confidence indicator)
- Highly technical content (AI simplifies for executive level, flags technical details for appendix)
- Multiple problems/solutions (AI prioritizes based on business purpose selection)
- AI processing timeout (> 90 seconds) → error message, retry option

---

- System prompt includes Roam principles (visual thinking, simplicity)
- System prompt includes executive communication rules (decision-first, data-light)
- Business purpose dynamically adjusts prompt focus areas
- Output format strictly enforced (3 slides, specific structure)

**Prompt Template** (Simplified):
```
You are a presentation strategist trained in Nancy Duarte and Dan Roam principles.

INPUT: [Original presentation text], [Business purpose: {purpose}]

TASK: Condense to exactly 3 slides following this structure:

SLIDE 1 - THE PROBLEM:
- Visual description: [Specific visual that conveys problem magnitude]
- One sentence: [Max 15 words crystallizing the problem]

SLIDE 2 - THE SOLUTION:
- Visual description: [Specific diagram/data viz showing impact]
- One sentence: [Max 15 words stating the solution]

SLIDE 3 - THE ASK:
- Visual description: [Timeline, ROI, or success criteria visual]
- One sentence: [Max 15 words stating the ask]

PRINCIPLES:
1. Start with decision, not background (Duarte)
2. Visual over verbal - executives process images 60,000x faster (Roam)
3. No jargon, no bullet points
4. Specific visuals (e.g., "Bar chart: Q1 $2M → Q4 target $5M" not "revenue chart")
5. Business purpose focus: [Dynamic based on {purpose}]

OUTPUT FORMAT: JSON
{
  "slide1": {"visual": "...", "sentence": "..."},
  "slide2": {"visual": "...", "sentence": "..."},
  "slide3": {"visual": "...", "sentence": "..."}
}
```

---

#### AI-002: "Why We Cut This" Report Generation
**Description**: AI SHALL generate educational report with specific principles
**Requirements**:
- Analyze each slide in original deck
- Categorize decisions: CUT (deleted), MOVED (to appendix), CONDENSED (merged)
- Cite specific principle for each decision
- Organize chronologically by slide number
- Limit to 5-15 explanations (avoid overwhelming)

**Prompt Template** (Simplified):
```
Analyze the original presentation and explain why each section was cut/moved/condensed.

FORMAT for each explanation:
**Slides [X-Y] ([Title]):**
❌ CUT: [What was removed]
✅ WHY: [Reason tied to executive communication needs]
📚 PRINCIPLE: [Duarte/Roam principle cited]
📁 LOCATION: [Deleted, moved to appendix, or condensed to Slide N]

PRINCIPLES TO REFERENCE:
- Decision-first structure (executives start with conclusion)
- Visual over verbal (images process faster than text)
- Simplicity (one idea per slide)
- Contrast (focus attention on what matters)
- Signal-to-noise ratio (remove non-essential data)

OUTPUT: 5-15 explanations covering major decisions
```

---

#### AI-003: Output Validation & Fallbacks
**Description**: System SHALL validate AI output and handle failures
**Requirements**:
- Validate JSON structure (3 slides, required fields)
- Validate word counts (≤15 words per sentence)
- Validate visual descriptions (not empty, sufficiently specific)
- If validation fails: retry with adjusted prompt (1 retry max)
- If retry fails: use fallback template + notify user of partial success

**Fallback Template**:
```
Slide 1: [Problem from original deck's stated goal]
Slide 2: [Solution from original deck's approach]
Slide 3: [Ask from original deck's conclusion or inferred from purpose]
Note: "AI processing encountered issues. This is a simplified version. Please review and adjust."
```

---

#### AI-004: Token Management
**Description**: System SHALL optimize AI API costs and latency
**Requirements**:
- Limit input tokens: If original deck > 30 slides, pre-summarize to 10,000 tokens max
- Limit output tokens: Enforce max 500 tokens for 3-slide output
- Use efficient model: Claude Sonnet or GPT-4-turbo (balance cost/quality)
- Cache system prompt (if API supports) to reduce costs
- Monitor token usage per session (log for cost analysis)

**Cost Estimation**:
- Input: 10,000 tokens avg × $0.003/1K = $0.03
- Output: 500 tokens avg × $0.015/1K = $0.0075
- Total per session: ~$0.04
- Hackathon budget: 100 sessions × $0.04 = $4

---

#### AI-005: Quality Assurance
**Description**: AI outputs SHALL meet quality standards
**Requirements**:
- Grammar check: Sentences are grammatically correct (use AI's native capabilities)
- Jargon check: Flag technical terms unfamiliar to general executive audience
- Coherence check: Slides logically flow (Problem → Solution → Ask)
- Tone check: Professional, confident, action-oriented (not passive or uncertain)

**Quality Metrics** (post-launch):
- User satisfaction rating: ≥4/5 stars
- Edit rate: <30% of users heavily edit AI output
- Completion rate: ≥80% users download PDF (vs. abandon)

---

### Risk Buffer
**Built-in slack time**:
- Day 7: Mid-sprint adjustment (catch-up if behind)
- Day 12-13: UI polish (can be shortened if features delayed)
- Day 14-15: Testing (can extend into Day 16 morning if needed)

**Scope Reduction Triggers** (if running behind):
1. Cut revision interface (Should-Have feature)
2. Cut visual annotations (use text-only report)
3. Simplify PDF output (plain text, no styling)
4. Reduce AI prompt complexity (simpler explanations)

**Critical Path** (cannot be cut):
- Upload → AI Processing → Results Display → Download

---

## Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

#### Risk 1: AI Output Quality Inconsistent
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: High (core value proposition)

**Mitigation**:
- Test with 20+ diverse presentations during development
- Iteratively refine prompts based on output quality
- Implement output validation (reject poor quality, retry)
- Create fallback templates for edge cases
- Budget extra time for prompt engineering (Day 5-6)

**Contingency**: If AI consistently underperforms, simplify to extraction-based approach (identify problem/solution/ask from slide titles/conclusions)

---

#### Risk 2: PDF Processing Complexity
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (blocks user flow)

**Mitigation**:
- Choose battle-tested library (pdfplumber for Python, pdf-parse for Node.js)
- Test with 10+ PDFs from different sources (PowerPoint export, Keynote, Google Slides)
- Handle edge cases (multi-column, images, tables) with graceful degradation
- Provide clear error messages for unsupported formats

**Contingency**: If extraction fails frequently, require specific PDF export settings (documented in UI) or provide template for users to follow

---

#### Risk 3: Deployment Issues
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: High (demo failure)

**Mitigation**:
- Deploy to production early (Day 10, not Day 15)
- Test deployed version daily (not just localhost)
- Use reliable hosting (Vercel/Railway with good uptime)
- Create deployment checklist
- Prepare video backup of demo (if live demo fails)

**Contingency**: Localhost demo as last resort (less impressive but functional)

---

#### Risk 4: AI API Rate Limits or Downtime
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: High (demo failure)

**Mitigation**:
- Use OpenRouter (multiple model fallbacks)
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff
- Monitor API status before demo (check status page)
- Pre-process demo presentations (cache results if API fails during demo)

**Contingency**: Use pre-generated results for demo (show live upload but use cached AI output)

---

### Timeline Risks

#### Risk 5: Scope Creep
**Probability**: High
**Impact**: Medium (delays launch)

**Mitigation**:
- Strict MoSCoW prioritization (documented in PRD)
- Daily standups to catch scope additions early
- Feature freeze after Day 12 (only bug fixes)
- System Architect has veto power on new features

**Contingency**: Cut Should-Have features (revision interface, visual annotations)

---

#### Risk 6: Team Member Unavailability
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (slows progress)

**Mitigation**:
- Cross-train on critical components (no single point of failure)
- Daily code commits (work visible to all)
- Clear task ownership (documented in project board)
- Built-in buffer days (Day 7, Day 14-15)

**Contingency**: Architect fills in for unavailable team member (full-stack capability)

---

### User Experience Risks

#### Risk 7: Users Don't Understand Value Proposition
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Medium (poor demo reception)

**Mitigation**:
- Clear landing page copy (value prop in headline)
- Show before/after example (40 slides → 3 slides)
- Emphasize educational angle ("Why We Cut This")
- Test messaging with 3 external users before demo

**Contingency**: Refine messaging based on user feedback (Days 12-13)

---

#### Risk 8: AI Output Doesn't Match User Expectations
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Medium (user dissatisfaction)

**Mitigation**:
- Set expectations in UI ("AI-powered suggestions, not final slides")
- Provide "Why We Cut This" context (builds trust)
- Allow revisions (if time permits)
- User testing to identify expectation gaps

**Contingency**: Add disclaimer: "Use as foundation, customize for your audience"

---

### Business Risks

#### Risk 9: Competitive Product Launches During Hackathon
**Probability**: Low
**Impact**: Low (hackathon is about execution, not market exclusivity)

**Mitigation**:
- Focus on unique differentiators (educational angle, condensation not expansion)
- Emphasize speed-to-demo (first-mover advantage in hackathon)

**Contingency**: Pivot messaging to highlight differences if competitor appears

---

#### Risk 10: Post-Hackathon Team Availability Uncertain
**Probability**: Medium
**Impact**: Low (hackathon success independent of long-term plans)

**Mitigation**:
- Build extensible architecture (future-proofed)
- Document thoroughly (README, API docs, architecture diagrams)
- Keep post-hackathon plans aspirational (not commitments)

**Contingency**: Open-source project if team disbands (community can extend)

---

## FAQ

### Product Questions

**Q1: Why focus on condensation instead of creation?**
A: Every AI tool helps you create more slides (Gamma, Copilot, ChatGPT). No tool helps you cut ruthlessly. Executives don't need more content—they need less. SlideRx solves the harder, more valuable problem.

**Q2: Why 3 slides specifically?**
A: Research shows executives make decisions in first 3-5 minutes. Three slides (Problem, Solution, Ask) is the minimum viable structure for decision-making. Anything less is incomplete; anything more is unnecessary for initial approval.

**Q3: How is this different from ChatGPT + manual editing?**
A: ChatGPT gives generic advice ("be concise"). SlideRx generates actual slides + explains every decision with specific principles. It's the difference between "eat healthy" and a personalized meal plan with nutritional explanations.

**Q4: What if my presentation is already concise (15 slides)?**
A: SlideRx adapts. If you're already concise, the report will highlight what you did right and suggest minor refinements. The educational value remains even if condensation is minimal.

**Q5: Can I edit the 3-slide output?**
A: Yes. The PDF is a foundation, not a final product. You customize with your company's template, add visuals, adjust tone. SlideRx gets you 80% of the way in 60 seconds instead of 8 hours.

### Technical Questions

**Q6: Why PDF input instead of PPTX?**
A: MVP speed. PDF parsing is simpler and universal (every presentation tool exports PDF). PPTX support is on the roadmap post-hackathon.

**Q7: How do you extract text from PDFs accurately?**
A: We use battle-tested libraries (pdfplumber/pdf-parse) that handle most standard PDFs. For edge cases (scanned images, complex layouts), we provide clear error messages and ask users to re-export.

**Q8: Which AI model are you using?**
A: Claude Sonnet 3.5 via OpenRouter (primary), with GPT-4-turbo as fallback. OpenRouter gives us flexibility to switch models based on quality/cost/speed without changing our code.

**Q9: How do you prevent AI hallucination?**
A: Strict output validation (3 slides, word counts, structure), prompt engineering (specific instructions), and source grounding (AI summarizes original content, doesn't invent). If validation fails, we retry or use fallback template.

**Q10: What's the estimated cost per user session?**
A: ~$0.04 per session (AI API costs). At scale, this decreases with optimized prompts and caching. Premium tier ($9/month) supports 225 sessions to break even.

### Business Questions

**Q11: Is this a real business or just a hackathon project?**
A: Hackathon-first, real business potential. We're validating technical feasibility and product-market fit during the hackathon. Post-hackathon decisions depend on user feedback and team availability.

**Q12: Who are your target customers?**
A: Corporate professionals (PMs, consultants, analysts) who present to executives. Secondary: founders pitching VCs, sales teams pitching clients. Anyone who needs to "sell" an idea to time-constrained decision-makers.

**Q13: How will you compete with free AI tools?**
A: Specialization. ChatGPT is general-purpose. SlideRx is specialized for presentations with proven principles (Duarte/Roam), generates actual slides (not advice), and teaches users to improve. Vertical SaaS beats horizontal generalists.

**Q14: What's your go-to-market strategy?**
A: Product-led growth. Free tier for viral adoption, premium tier for monetization. Content marketing (LinkedIn posts showing before/after transformations), community building (presentation tips), and word-of-mouth (users share results).

### Hackathon-Specific Questions

**Q15: What makes this a good hackathon project?**
A:
- **Demonstrable**: Visual before/after is compelling
- **Feasible**: Core flow achievable in 16 days with 3 people
- **Novel**: No direct competitor doing condensation + education
- **Valuable**: Solves real pain point for large audience
- **Extensible**: Clear roadmap for post-hackathon development

**Q16: What's your fallback if AI doesn't work well?**
A: Simplify to rule-based extraction (identify problem/solution/ask from slide titles, conclusions, headers). Less impressive but still demonstrates value. Pre-generate demo results as last resort.

**Q17: How will you handle the live demo?**
A: Prepare 3 demo presentations (budget request, status update, pitch). Practice demo flow 5x. Have video backup if live demo fails. Test on actual demo network/device day before.

## Appendix

### Presentation Best Practices (Condensed Reference)

#### Nancy Duarte Principles
1. **Contrast**: Make important elements stand out (size, color, position)
2. **Whitespace**: Give content room to breathe (dense slides = cognitive overload)
3. **Repetition**: Consistent visual language builds trust
4. **Alignment**: Create visual order (grids, alignment guide)
5. **Proximity**: Group related elements
6. **Emotional Resonance**: Connect with audience feelings, not just logic

**Key Insight**: "Story is the pathway to engaging the audience's heart" - structure matters more than polish.

#### Dan Roam (Visual Thinking) Principles
1. **Show, Don't Tell**: Visual explanations > text explanations (60,000x faster processing)
2. **Simple Visuals**: Stick figures and basic shapes work better than complex graphics
3. **Six Ways to See**: Who/What, How Much, Where, When, How, Why (choose the right visual for each)
4. **The Back of the Napkin**: If you can't sketch it simply, you don't understand it

**Key Insight**: "Any problem can be made clearer with a picture" - visuals clarify thinking.

---

#### Executive Communication Principles
1. **Decision-First**: Start with recommendation, then support (not background → conclusion)
2. **Pyramid Principle**: Main idea first, supporting details later
3. **So What?**: Every slide must answer "Why does this matter to the decision?"
4. **Data-Ink Ratio**: Maximize information per pixel (remove chart junk)
5. **One Idea Per Slide**: Cognitive load management

**Key Insight**: Executives optimize for decision-making speed, not comprehensive understanding.

### Example Transformations

#### Before: Typical 40-Slide Budget Request Deck
```
Slide 1: Title
Slide 2: Agenda
Slide 3-4: Team introductions
Slide 5-12: Market analysis (competitors, trends, sizing)
Slide 13-18: Problem deep-dive (customer interviews, data)
Slide 19-25: Solution features (6 bullets per slide)
Slide 26-30: Technical architecture
Slide 31-35: Implementation timeline
Slide 36-38: Budget breakdown
Slide 39: ROI calculation
Slide 40: Conclusion (buried ask)
```

#### After: SlideRx 3-Slide Output
```
SLIDE 1: THE PROBLEM
Visual: Bar chart showing customer churn rate increase (15% → 32% over 2 years) vs. industry avg (10%)
Sentence: "We're losing $5M annually to preventable customer churn."

SLIDE 2: THE SOLUTION
Visual: Workflow diagram showing current manual process (8 steps, 3 weeks) vs. proposed automated system (2 steps, 2 days)
Sentence: "Automated retention platform reduces churn response time from 3 weeks to 2 days."

SLIDE 3: THE ASK
Visual: ROI timeline showing $2M investment returning $5M savings over 18 months
Sentence: "$2M investment saves $5M annually, break-even in 5 months."
```

**Why We Cut This (Excerpt)**:
- Slides 5-12 (Market Analysis): Moved to appendix. Market size doesn't change the ROI calculation—executives care about our specific savings.
- Slides 19-25 (Feature Lists): Condensed to workflow visual. Executives don't need feature details—they need to understand impact (3 weeks → 2 days).
- Slides 26-30 (Technical Architecture): Deleted. Technical feasibility is engineering's concern, not the budget decision.
