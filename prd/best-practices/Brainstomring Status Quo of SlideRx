# SlideRx: Feature & Idea Base

## Core Value Proposition
Transform bloated business presentations into executive-ready summaries while teaching presentation principles. Goes beyond surface polishing—actually condenses and educates.

## MVP Features (Hackathon Scope)

## Key Differentiators

**vs. Gamma.ai:** No confusing one-sentence-at-a-time generation. Clear purpose-driven condensation.

**vs. Microsoft Copilot:** Actually condenses instead of just polishing. Teaches WHY decisions were made.

**Unique Angle:** Multi-user versioning + learning mode = tool that improves both your deck AND your skills.

## Marketing Positioning

**Headline:** "Your CEO doesn't have 40 minutes. We give them 3."

**Testimonial Format:** "Before: 40 slides, 12% approval rate. After: 3 slides, 89% approval rate."

**Target Audience:** Corporate professionals, consultants, product managers, anyone presenting to executives
